# AES-Python
This is a small repo to hold the code for a cryptography project. aesAlice.py asks the user for a secret message, encrypts the message using The Advanced Encryption Standard and then saves the ciphertext to a text file. aesBob.py extracts the ciphertext from said textfile and then prints the original secret message input in aesAlice.py.
